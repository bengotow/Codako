  "readme": "# CoffeeScript Compiler\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is a node module which allows you to compile CoffeeScript code (strings of code or files containing code) to JavaScript from JavaScript. Output is provided as a string and can optionally be written out to a file.\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can install this package via `npm install coffeescript-compiler`. Please note that this package does **NOT** define any version of `coffee-script` as a dependency for any reason other than testing. You must either have the `coffee` command available in your path or have the complete path to access the `coffee` command.\n\nAll examples assume that you have included this module and created a new `Compiler` as follows:\n\n\tvar Compiler = require('coffeescript-compiler');\n\tvar cc = new Compiler();\n\nAssuming you have `coffee` on your path, compiling a string of CoffeeScript (in this example, `a = 5`) is simple:\n\n\tcc.compile('a = 5', function (status, output) {\n\t\tif (status === 0) {\n\t\t\t// JavaScript available as a string in the `output` variable\n\t\t}\n\t});\n\nYou can get a bare compilation (no wrapper function) by passing in a configuration object as the second argument to `compile(...)`:\n\n\tcc.compile('a = 5', {bare: true}, function (status, output) {\n\t\tif (status === 0) {\n\t\t\t// Bare JavaScript available as a string in the `output` variable\n\t\t}\n\t});\n\nThe configuration object can contain the following options:\n\n* `asFileName`: If set to `true` the first argument passed to `compile` is treated as a file name rather than an input string. If this is set and an error is encountered while reading the error will be thrown.\n* `bare`: Compiles input to bare JavaScript if set to `true`.\n* `writeFile`: A string containing a filename to write JavaScript output to. If this is set and an error is encountered while writing the error will be thrown.\n\n## License\n\n**The MIT License**\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Kenneth Powers\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

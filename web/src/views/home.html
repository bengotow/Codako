	  <h3>Research Based Approach</h3>
	  <p>Codako is heavily inspired by the KidSIM research conducted by Apple's Advanced Technologies Group in the late 1990s, which showed that students were very successful in programming-by-demonstration environments. As Codako is developed, several more studies will be conducted around it's effectiveness.</p>

	  <h3>Built with love</h3>
	  <p>Codako will always be free to play, and will never collect information beyond the required email address, nickname and password. 20 years ago, I learned to program using Apple's KidSIM, and Codako is my effort to bring back the platform that inspired me in my childhood.</p>

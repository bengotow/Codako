			  <h3><i class="icon-foursquare"></i> Learn Core Concepts</h3>
			  <p>Codako introduces many programming concepts, without young learners needing to write actual code. It lays a foundation of understanding that students can carry with them as they learn to program.

	  <h3>Based on research</h3>
	  <p>Codako is heavily inspired by the KidSIM research conducted by Apple's Advanced Technologies Group in the late 1990s, which identified the potential programming-by-demonstration environments had for engaging and teaching core concepts to young learners. Codako's web foundation introduces new oppotunities and new challenges, and we're looking for partners to help conduct another round of research.</p>

	  <h3>Advanced concepts, no downloads</h3>
	  <p>Codako was designed to be simple, and students can learn about advanced features as they need them. It supports variables, events, control flow blocks, and more! It was built from the ground up on HTML5 and Javascript run on anything with a modern browser. No downloads or plugins are required.

	  <h3>Built with love</h3>
	  <p>Codako will always be free to play, and will never collect information beyond the required email address, nickname and password. 20 years ago, I learned to program using Apple's KidSIM, and Codako is my effort to bring back the platform that inspired me in my childhood. For more about why I've built Codako, see the <a href="/#/parents">FAQ for Parents</a></p>
